## üöÄ Introduction

In this fascinating project, we use an Arduino and an L298 Motor Driver to create a **Line Follower Robot** capable of **avoiding obstacles**. This robot is ideal for automating tasks like object transportation or even fun robotic racing. It dynamically adapts to its environment using both IR and Ultrasonic sensors.

## üîå Circuit Diagram

The circuit is powered by two 3.7V batteries in series (7.4V total). IR sensors detect line paths, while an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo scans the front and sides for obstacles. Motor speed and direction are controlled via L298 Motor Driver and Arduino pins.

## üß† How It Works

- **Pin Definitions:** Motor (enA‚ÄìB, in1‚Äì4), IR sensors (L_S, R_S), Ultrasonic (echo, trigger), Servo
- **Setup:** Initializes pins, sets PWM speeds, centers the servo, reads initial distances
- **Loop:** Reads sensors ‚Üí determines path or obstacle ‚Üí executes appropriate motor movement
- **Servo Scanning:** Servo sweeps sides to detect obstacles before deciding turn direction
- **Functions:** `forword()`, `backword()`, `turnLeft()`, `turnRight()`, `Stop()`

## üß™ Hardware Testing

1. Power on robot
2. Calibrate IR sensors to detect black/white surfaces
3. Test forward, turning, and obstacle detection manually
4. Tune delays and speed as needed for optimal pathing

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of combining **line-following logic** with **obstacle avoidance** using simple sensors and Arduino programming. It‚Äôs both a fun and educational introduction to **robotics**, **embedded systems**, and **autonomous navigation**.
